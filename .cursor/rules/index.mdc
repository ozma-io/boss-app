# The Boss App

## Tech Stack
React Native + Expo + TypeScript + Firebase (Firestore, Auth, FCM, Cloud Functions)

## Key Rules
- TypeScript strict typing required
- Functional components with hooks
- Expo Router file-based routing
- User data scoped to `userId` (Firebase rules enforce `request.auth.uid === userId`)
- Two-step permission flows (custom UI + system prompt) for notifications and tracking transparency (pre-auth capable)

## Run Locally
- `npm start` — dev server (choose platform)
- `npm run web` — web browser
- `npm run ios` — iOS simulator

## Documentation
- **Quick start**: `README.md`
- **Setup guide**: `SETUP.md`
- **All docs**: `docs/README.md` (Firebase, Firestore, Auth)

## Project Structure
- `app/` — Screens (Expo Router)
- `components/` — Reusable UI
- `services/` — Firebase services
- `firestore/` — Schemas & migrations
- `functions/` — Cloud Functions
