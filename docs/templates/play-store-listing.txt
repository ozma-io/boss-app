Track Your Professional Context

Store key information about your manager:
• Communication style and preferences
• Management approach and expectations
• Working dynamics and relationship patterns
• Custom fields for what matters in your workplace

Document important interactions:
• Meeting notes and conversations
• Feedback received from your manager
• Achievements and completed projects
• Challenges you faced and solved
• Performance review preparation

AI Assistant for Real Workplace Situations

Ask specific questions about your professional challenges and get personalized recommendations based on your actual documented context - not generic career advice.

"How should I approach my manager about a promotion?"
"What's the best way to discuss this project setback?"
"How do I prepare for my upcoming performance review?"

The assistant understands your manager's style, your track record, and your career goals. You get guidance that actually fits your unique situation.

Proactive Career Reminders

BossUp actively helps you stay on track with your career development. Get timely reminders to:
• Document important interactions before you forget
• Follow up on feedback and commitments

Why BossUp Works

Generic career advice ignores your reality. Your manager's style, your company culture, your specific goals - these matter. BossUp learns from your documented experiences to provide context-aware guidance for your actual workplace scenarios.
