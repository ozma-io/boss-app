# Facebook Conversions API Secret (Server-side only)
# 
# IMPORTANT: This .env file is ONLY for local development and emulators.
# For production, use Firebase Secret Manager instead:
#   firebase functions:secrets:set FACEBOOK_ACCESS_TOKEN
#
# Copy this file to .env and fill in your actual value for local testing.
# Never commit .env to git!

# Get this token from:
# Option 1: Facebook Events Manager → Pixel Settings → Conversions API → Generate Access Token
# Option 2: Business Manager → System Users → Generate Token with ads_management permission

# For local development/emulators (uncomment if needed):
# FACEBOOK_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_facebook_access_token_here

# Note: 
# - FACEBOOK_PIXEL_ID and FACEBOOK_API_VERSION are hardcoded in src/constants.ts
# - For production, the function uses Secret Manager (defined via defineSecret in code)
# - Keep .env commented out or empty for production deploys to avoid conflicts
